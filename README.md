# Face-Recognition


Facial recognition is a technique for recognizing or verifying a person’s identification by looking at their face. This technology can recognize persons in photographs, videos, and in real-time. A type of biometric security is facial recognition. Although there is growing interest in other applications, the technology is mostly employed for security and law enforcement. Typically, face recognition does not need a large database of images to identify an individual’s identification; rather, it merely identifies and recognizes one person as the device’s only owner, while restricting access to others.
